## Bio

Hi, I'm Arjun! I am a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the **[University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/)** advised by **[Haewon Jeong](https://www.haewonjeong.com/)**.

My research interests are broadly in the theory and applications of **responsible and robust machine learning**. In the past, I have worked on applications of machine learning in many fields including cardiology, transportation, and sports as well as explored properties of the representation space of deep learning models. Check out some of my work below!

I completed my BS degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at the **University of California, San Diego** and my MS degree in Computer Science at **Columbia University**, where I worked with **[Brian Smith](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~brian/)** in the **[Computer-enabled Abilites Laboratory](https://ceal.cs.columbia.edu/)**.

In my free time, I enjoy following baseball, playing board games, and composing music.
