## Bio

Hi, I'm Arjun! I am a first-year PhD student in the Compute Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

My research interests are broadly in responsible, fair, and robust  machine learning. In the past, I have explored applications of machine learning in many fields including cardiology, transportation, and sports. Check out some of my work below!

I completed my BS degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego and my MS degree in Computer Science from Columbia University.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music.
