## Bio

Hi, I'm Arjun! I am a first-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara advised by Professor Haewon Jeong.

My research interests are broadly in responsible, fair, and robust  machine learning. At Columbia, I worked with Professor Brian Smith in CEAL. In the past, I have explored applications of machine learning in many fields including cardiology, transportation, and sports. Check out some of my work below!

I completed my BS degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego and my MS degree in Computer Science from Columbia University.

In my free time, I enjoy playing music.
